# Code Review Findings

This document summarizes the findings of the comprehensive code review of the UpGuard CyberRisk MCP Server.

## `src/api/client.js`

### Architectural & Design Patterns

*   **Severity:** Suggestion
*   **Description:** The file uses a centralized `request` function to handle all API calls, which is a good design pattern. It also uses a resilience pattern (`withResilience`) to handle transient errors, which is a good practice for building robust applications.
*   **Recommendation:** The file could be improved by using a more modular approach. For example, the risk-related API calls could be moved to a separate file (`src/api/risks.js`) to improve code organization and maintainability.

### Performance Optimization

*   **Severity:** Suggestion
*   **Description:** The file uses a caching mechanism to improve performance. However, the cache TTLs are hardcoded, which makes it difficult to configure the caching behavior for different environments.
*   **Recommendation:** The cache TTLs should be configurable through environment variables or a configuration file. This would allow for more flexible and environment-specific caching strategies.

### Security Vulnerabilities

*   **Severity:** Low
*   **Description:** The API key is logged when an error occurs. Although the authorization header is redacted in the request logging, the `error.config` object might still contain the full `Authorization` header, which could be logged in the `enhancedError.details`.
*   **Recommendation:** Ensure that the `Authorization` header is always redacted from the error logs.

### Code Quality & Maintainability

*   **Severity:** Suggestion
*   **Description:** The file could be improved by adding more detailed comments to the functions and by using more descriptive variable names.
*   **Recommendation:** Add more detailed comments to the functions and use more descriptive variable names to improve code readability and maintainability.

### Error Handling & Robustness

*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Description:** The error handling is good, but it could be improved by providing more specific error messages for different types of errors. For example, the `getErrorMessage` function could be extended to handle more error codes and to provide more context-specific error messages.
*   **Recommendation:** Extend the `getErrorMessage` function to handle more error codes and to provide more context-specific error messages.

## `src/utils/retry.js`

### Architectural & Design Patterns

*   **Severity:** Suggestion
*   **Description:** The file implements a `RetryPolicy` and a `CircuitBreaker` class, which are common resilience patterns. The `withResilience` function combines these two patterns to provide a robust mechanism for handling transient errors. This is a good design that promotes code reuse and maintainability.
*   **Recommendation:** The `CircuitBreaker` implementation could be improved by making the success threshold for closing the circuit configurable. Currently, it is hardcoded to 3 successful calls.

### Code Quality & Maintainability

*   **Severity:** Suggestion
*   **Description:** The file is well-structured and easy to understand. However, it could be improved by adding more detailed comments to the classes and methods.
*   **Recommendation:** Add more detailed comments to the classes and methods to improve code readability and maintainability.

### Error Handling & Robustness

*   **Severity:** Suggestion
*   **Description:** The `RetryPolicy` class retries on a predefined set of error codes and status codes. This is a good practice, but it could be improved by allowing the user to provide a custom retry policy for specific operations.
*   **Recommendation:** Allow the user to provide a custom retry policy for specific operations. This would provide more flexibility and control over the retry behavior.

## `src/utils/cache.js`

### Architectural & Design Patterns

*   **Severity:** Suggestion
*   **Description:** The file implements an `EnhancedCache` class with TTL, LRU eviction, and statistics. It also provides an `APICache` class that extends `EnhancedCache` and adds a smart key generation mechanism for API responses. This is a good design that promotes code reuse and maintainability.
*   **Recommendation:** The `APICache` class could be improved by adding support for different caching strategies, such as cache-aside, read-through, and write-through. This would provide more flexibility and control over the caching behavior.

### Performance Optimization

*   **Severity:** Suggestion
*   **Description:** The `evictLRU` method iterates over the entire `accessOrder` map to find the least recently used item. This can be inefficient for large caches.
*   **Recommendation:** The `accessOrder` map could be replaced with a doubly linked list to provide O(1) access to the least recently used item. This would improve the performance of the `evictLRU` method.

### Code Quality & Maintainability

*   **Severity:** Suggestion
*   **Description:** The file is well-structured and easy to understand. However, it could be improved by adding more detailed comments to the classes and methods.
*   **Recommendation:** Add more detailed comments to the classes and methods to improve code readability and maintainability.

### Error Handling & Robustness

*   **Severity:** Suggestion
*   **Description:** The `cleanup` method is called periodically to remove expired items from the cache. However, if the `cleanup` method fails for some reason, it will not be called again until the next interval.
*   **Recommendation:** The `cleanup` method should be wrapped in a `try...catch` block to ensure that it is always called, even if it fails.
