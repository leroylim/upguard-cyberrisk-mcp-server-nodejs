# System Architecture & Design

This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture and design of the UpGuard CyberRisk MCP Server.

## 1. Architectural Overview

The UpGuard CyberRisk MCP Server is a Node.js application that acts as a bridge between the UpGuard CyberRisk API and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) client. It exposes the functionality of the UpGuard API through a standardized MCP interface, allowing users to interact with the API in a consistent and predictable way.

The server is designed to be a standalone application that can be run in any environment that supports Node.js. It can be run in either STDIO or HTTP transport mode, depending on the needs of the client.

### 1.1. Major Components

The system is composed of the following major components:

*   **MCP Server:** The core component of the application. It is responsible for handling MCP requests, parsing them, and dispatching them to the appropriate tool.
*   **Tools:** The individual units of functionality that are exposed through the MCP interface. Each tool corresponds to a specific UpGuard API endpoint.
*   **API Client:** The component that is responsible for communicating with the UpGuard API. It handles authentication, request signing, and error handling.
*   **Cache:** The component that is responsible for caching API responses to improve performance.
*   **Resilience Layer:** The component that is responsible for handling transient errors and ensuring the reliability of the application.

### 1.2. Data Flow

The data flow of the application is as follows:

1.  An MCP client sends a request to the MCP server.
2.  The MCP server parses the request and dispatches it to the appropriate tool.
3.  The tool uses the API client to send a request to the UpGuard API.
4.  The API client checks the cache for a valid response. If a valid response is found, it is returned to the tool.
5.  If a valid response is not found in the cache, the API client sends a request to the UpGuard API.
6.  The UpGuard API returns a response to the API client.
7.  The API client caches the response and returns it to the tool.
8.  The tool processes the response and returns it to the MCP server.
9.  The MCP server sends the response to the MCP client.

## 2. Design Decisions

The following are some of the key design decisions that were made during the development of the application:

*   **Modular Architecture:** The application is designed to be modular, with each component having a single responsibility. This makes the application easy to understand, maintain, and extend.
*   **Resilience Patterns:** The application uses a combination of retry and circuit breaker patterns to handle transient errors. This makes the application more reliable and resilient to failures.
*   **Caching:** The application uses a caching mechanism to improve performance. The cache is configurable and can be customized for different environments.
*   **Schema Validation:** The application uses Zod for schema validation. This ensures that the data that is sent to the UpGuard API is valid and that the data that is returned from the API is what is expected.

## 3. Technical Trade-offs

The following are some of the technical trade-offs that were made during the development of the application:

*   **In-Memory Cache:** The application uses an in-memory cache, which is fast but not persistent. This means that the cache will be lost if the application is restarted. A distributed cache, such as Redis, could be used to provide a persistent cache, but this would add complexity to the application.
*   **Single-Threaded:** The application is single-threaded, which means that it can only handle one request at a time. This can be a bottleneck for high-traffic applications. A multi-threaded or asynchronous architecture could be used to improve performance, but this would also add complexity to the application.
